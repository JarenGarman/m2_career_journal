# Mod 2 Career Journal
The point of this career journal is to assist you in keeping track of the "story" of your Turing journey! When you start interviewing, writing your resume, and are fully on the job hunt, these details will be super handy for you to have. 

At the end of each project (eval days are great for this), carefully consider and fill out each project's reflection questions below.

You will use the prompts in this README to reflect on their Mod 2 projects.  You will need to copy the markdown of these prompts, by either creating your own private gist, or creating a google doc. Then paste the markdown into your own document for future editing.   

After you've done that, please DM your instructors your newly-forked link.
