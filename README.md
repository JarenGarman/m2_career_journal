### Solo Project Reflections

1. At the beginning of the project, what part(s) of the project were you most nervous about? At the end, do you feel those concerns were justified?

    I was most nervous about the layout and styling with CSS. It did end up being a bit easier than I imagined but I also learned a lot in the process.

2. Describe one thing you got stuck on during the project. Based on that experience, have you made/do you plan to make any specific changes to the way you prepare for the next project?

    I did get stuck for a while on deleting a specific object from an array. I initially used filter to reassign the array to a new one without the target element. I ended up refactoring to turn the array into and object to make it easier to delete a particular element. After doing this, I ended up helping some of my cohortmates with their projects and learned some cool ways that they had figured out to delete an element from an array. Next project, I will lean more heavily on our codehelp slack channel to get help from my cohortmates.
